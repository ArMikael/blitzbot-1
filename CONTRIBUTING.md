How to Contribute
=================

Thanks for taking the time to think about improving [blitzbot]!

Reporting Problems
------------------

 1. Get the current version via `@blitzbot version`.
 1. Capture the original command, the response (or the lack thereof) with a screenshot.
 2. Look for an existing [issue](//github.com/CodeMan99/blitzbot/issues). Add to any related issue.
 3. Repeat your steps that creates the problem(s).
 4. Create a new issue if you haven't reported everything yet.
 5. You may alternatively direct message the author that was listed in the version response.

Code Changes
------------

 1. Fork the repository.
 2. Create a branch that describes your work. We prefer you use a name that will describe your pull request.
 Long names are fine!
 3. Write documentation. Especially true if you know what your change will be. If you are having trouble
 documenting your change, consider writing an [issue](//github.com/CodeMan99/blitzbot/issues) to discuss
 your change.
 4. Write your change. Try to follow the same style as the code you are working on.
 5. Test your change. Preferrably, write a *new* test over changing an *existing* test.
 6. Create your pull request against the [default branch](//github.com/CodeMan99/blitzbot/commits).
 7. Correct any errors reported by the [ci server](https://travis-ci.org/CodeMan99/blitzbot).

Feature Requests
----------------

All feature request discussions belong on your discord server. If a suggestion is made often enough,
or if it just sounds really awesome the author will eventually implement it!

Alternatively, you may join the [blitzbot-test](https://discord.gg/0yWBq3ILDxT9ZPZB) discord server
for discussions.
